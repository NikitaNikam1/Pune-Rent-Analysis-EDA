# Pune Rent Analysis 🏙️📊

## Project Overview
This project analyzes rental housing data in Pune to understand how factors such as
carpet area, BHK configuration, furnishing type, and locality influence rental prices.

The data was scraped from the MagicBricks real estate website and analyzed using
Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.

## Business Problem
Rental prices in Pune vary significantly across localities and property configurations.
Factors such as BHK, carpet area, furnishing status, and location influence rental prices.
Without structured analysis, it becomes difficult to compare properties and make
informed decisions.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze rent distribution and identify outliers
- Study the relationship between carpet area and rent
- Understand how BHK configuration affects rental prices
- Compare rental prices across Pune localities
- Identify key numerical factors influencing rent

---

## Data Source
- Website: MagicBricks (publicly available rental listings)
- City: Pune

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- BeautifulSoup
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Data Cleaning & Processing
- Removed irrelevant columns
- Converted rent values from text to numeric format
- Handled missing values using BHK-wise median imputation
- Standardized column names and verified data consistency

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key analyses performed:
- Rent distribution and outlier detection
- Carpet area vs rent relationship
- Average rent by BHK configuration
- Locality-wise rental price comparison
- Correlation analysis between numerical features

---

## Key Insights
- Rent shows a strong positive correlation with carpet area (0.94)
- 2–3 BHK units dominate the Pune rental market
- Premium localities like Kalyani Nagar and Baner command higher rents
- Carpet area is the strongest predictor of rental price

---

## Conclusion
Pune’s rental market is primarily driven by property size, configuration, and location.
This analysis provides clear insights into rental trends and can support better housing
and investment decisions.
